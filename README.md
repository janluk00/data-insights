## Description

This repository serves as a workspace for various projects related to data analysis and machine learning. It contains implementations of different algorithms and analyses on multiple datasets, with a focus on experimentation and development in data science.
## Repository Contents

### Backpropagation Algorithm
An implementation of the backpropagation algorithm used in neural networks for model training. This algorithm is fundamental to the optimization process in deep learning.

### Advertisement Regression Models
A data analysis project on advertisement data using regression models, such as linear regression and polynomial regression. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships in advertisement data and assess the impact of various factors on advertising outcomes.

### Wine Quality Analysis
A wine quality classification project based on the chemical properties of various wines. This includes the application of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron regressor to predict wine quality. The analysis utilizes machine learning techniques to evaluate the models' effectiveness.

### Summary
Each project is available as a Jupyter Notebook within its respective folder. The notebooks include detailed explanations of the methodology and results.
